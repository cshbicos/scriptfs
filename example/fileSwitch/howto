Purpose of this example:

  Depending on the calling programm, the file mirrored from ./mirror to ./mnt shows different content.
  The setting which content to show depending on the calling program is maintaind in ./lib/mapping
  Every time a new calling program wants the file, the first line is copied with the program information. 
  Edit the mapping file to change mappings

The exact use case:

  The example fakes various os-release versions depending on the caller.
  All that needs to be done is to symlink ./mnt/os-release to /etc/os-release.

Disclaimer:
  I'm not saying it's a good idea to do that for anything. At all. Ever.
